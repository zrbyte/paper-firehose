# Paper Firehose - RSS Feed Filtering and Ranking

  

A modular, CLI-based system for fetching research papers from RSS feeds, filtering them using regular expressions, and generating organized HTML summaries. Features a three-database architecture for efficient deduplication and historical tracking.

## Architecture


- **Modular Design**: Extensible processor-based architecture

- **CLI Interface**: Simple commands for filtering, ranking, and summarization

- **YAML Configuration**: Topic-specific configurations with regex patterns

- **Three-Database System**: Efficient deduplication and historical tracking

- **RSS Feed Processing**: Supports 33+ academic journal feeds

## Installation

Developed with **Python 3.11**. Install dependencies:
  

```bash

pip install -r requirements.txt

```

  

Key dependencies:

- [feedparser](https://pypi.org/project/feedparser/) - RSS parsing

- [PyYAML](https://pyyaml.org/) - Configuration management

- [click](https://click.palletsprojects.com/) - CLI framework

  

## Quick Start

  

```bash

# Check system status

python cli/main.py status

  

# Filter all topics

python cli/main.py filter

  

# Filter specific topic

python cli/main.py filter --topic primary

  

# Generate HTML for all topics from papers.db (no fetching)

python cli/main.py html

  

# Generate HTML for a single topic from papers.db

python cli/main.py html --topic primary

  

# Database cleanup

python cli/main.py purge --days 30 # Remove entries from last 30 days (including today)

```

  

## Configuration

  

### Main Configuration (`config/config.yaml`)

  

```yaml

database:

path: "assets/papers.db"

all_feeds_path: "assets/all_feed_entries.db"

history_path: "assets/matched_entries_history.db"

  

feeds:

cond-mat:

name: "arXiv Condensed Matter"

url: "https://rss.arxiv.org/rss/cond-mat"

enabled: true

nature:

name: "Nature"

url: "https://www.nature.com/nature.rss"

enabled: true

  

priority_journals:

- "nature"

- "science"

- "nat-mat"

```

  

### Topic Configuration (`config/topics/primary.yaml`)

  

```yaml

name: "Primary Research"

description: "Topological materials and condensed matter physics"

  

feeds:

- "cond-mat"

- "nature"

- "science"

  

filter:

pattern: "(topolog[a-z]+)|(graphit[a-z]+)|(weyl)|(dirac)"

fields: ["title", "summary"]

  

output:

filename: "results_primary.html"

```

  

## CLI Commands

  

### Core Commands

  

```bash

# Check system status and configuration

python cli/main.py status

  

# Filter RSS feeds and apply regex patterns

python cli/main.py filter [--topic TOPIC]

python cli/main.py html [--topic TOPIC]

  

# Database management

python cli/main.py purge --days 30 # Remove entries older than 30 days

python cli/main.py purge --all # Clear all databases

```

  

### Command Details

  

#### `filter`

Fetches RSS feeds, applies regex filters, and generates HTML output:

1. Fetches new entries from configured RSS feeds

2. Applies topic-specific regex patterns to titles and summaries

3. Includes entries from priority journals regardless of regex match

4. Stores filtered entries in three databases for efficient processing

5. Regenerates topic HTML for all topics from `papers.db`

  

#### `status`

Shows system configuration and health:

- Configuration file validation

- Available topics and enabled feeds

- Database paths and status

  

#### `purge`

Database cleanup and management:

- Remove entries from the most recent N days (including today) based on publication date

- Complete database reset for testing

- Maintains deduplication efficiency

## Database Architecture

  

The system uses a three-database approach for efficient processing and historical tracking:


### 1. `all_feed_entries.db` - Deduplication Database

- **Purpose**: Tracks all RSS entries ever fetched to prevent reprocessing

- **Contents**: Entry ID, feed name, title, link, authors, publication date

- **Retention**: Entries older than 4 months are automatically purged

- **Key Feature**: Only new entries (not in this database) are processed

  

### 2. `matched_entries_history.db` - Historical Matches

- **Purpose**: Permanent record of all entries that matched regex filters

- **Contents**: Entry metadata for all matched entries across all topics and runs

- **Retention**: Never automatically purged - accumulates all matches for historical analysis

- **Use Case**: Research trends, pattern analysis, long-term statistics

- **Key Feature**: **Topic Merging** - If an entry matches multiple topics, all topics are stored in a single record (e.g., "primary, rg")

  

### 3. `papers.db` - Current Run Processing

- **Purpose**: Working database for current processing session

- **Contents**: Filtered entries with processing status (filtered → ranked → summarized)

- **Lifecycle**: Cleared at start of each run, populated during processing

- **Features**: Composite primary key `PRIMARY KEY(id, topic)` stores one row per (entry, topic) so entries that match multiple topics are tracked independently. Supports workflow tracking and pause/resume functionality.
  


## Current Implementation Status

  

✅ **Phase 1 Complete** - Basic CLI and Filter Command

- Modular directory structure with extensible architecture

- YAML-based configuration system for feeds and topics

- Three-database approach for deduplication and historical tracking

- RSS feed processing with regex filtering

- **Improved HTML Generation**: Database-first approach with standalone capability

- CLI interface with `filter`, `status`, and `purge` commands

- **Topic Merging**: Intelligent deduplication across multiple topics

  

🚀 Ranking

- Sentence-Transformers based entry ranking that writes `rank_score` into `papers.db`.
- Uses per-topic ranking settings from `config/topics/<topic>.yaml` (`ranking.query`, optional `ranking.model`).
- Optional flag `--topic` lets you rank a single topic; omit to rank all topics.

Usage:

```
python cli/main.py rank               # rank all topics
python cli/main.py rank --topic primary
```

Notes:
- Install `sentence-transformers` to enable scoring: `pip install sentence-transformers`.
- If the model cannot be loaded, the command logs a warning and skips scoring gracefully.
- The command writes scores only to the DB.

  

🚧 **Phase 3** - Enhanced Summarization (Planned)

- LLM summarization of top-ranked entries

- Integration with topic-ranked HTML output

- Advanced PaperQA analysis for PDF processing

  

## HTML Generation

  

The system now features an improved HTML generation system that works directly from the database:
  

### **Usage Examples**

```python

# Generate HTML from current database state

pf.generate_html(topic="primary")

  

# Standalone HTML generation

from processors.html_generator import HTMLGenerator

html_gen = HTMLGenerator()

html_gen.generate_html_for_topic_from_database(db_manager, topic_name, output_path)

```

  

CLI usage:

  

```bash

# All topics

python cli/main.py html

  

# Specific topic

python cli/main.py html --topic primary

```


## Future Development

  

- **Improved Ranking**: Enhanced paper analysis using full PDF content

- **User Profiles**: Individual YAML configurations for different research groups

- **Web Interface**: Configuration management and result browsing

- **API Layer**: REST interface for programmatic access

- **Enhanced Analytics**: Trend analysis and research pattern detection


## Python API (Jupyter/Programmatic)

  

You can use the core functionality directly from Python (e.g., in notebooks):

#### `html`

Generate topic HTML directly from `papers.db` without fetching or filtering. Useful after a previous filter run or when only presentation needs updating.

  

```bash

# All topics

python cli/main.py html

  

# Single topic

python cli/main.py html --topic testtopic2

```

  

Uses entries with `status='filtered'` scoped to each topic.

  

```python

import paper_firehose as pf

  

# Inspect configuration status

pf.status()

  

# Run filtering for a specific topic (defaults to config/config.yaml)

pf.filter(topic="primary")

  

# Generate HTML for a topic directly from papers.db

pf.generate_html(topic="primary")

  

# Purge entries from the last N days (based on publication date)

# pf.purge(days=30)

  

# Purge all data (CAUTION)

# pf.purge(all_data=True)

```


### GitHub Actions Archiving (TODO)

- For GitHub Actions runs, persist `assets/all_feed_entries.db` and `assets/matched_entries_history.db` to a `data` branch so history and dedup state survive between CI runs.

- TODO:

- Add a workflow that checks out the `data` branch, copies updated DBs from `assets/`, commits, and pushes.

- Gate writes to `data` branch to CI context only.

- Consider attaching DB artifacts to releases for manual recovery.
