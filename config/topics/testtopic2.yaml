# Regex filter
filter:
  pattern: "parametric oscillation"
  fields: ["title", "summary"]

# Ranking configuration
ranking:
  prompt: "You are a world-class condensed-matter researcher specializing in 
    graphene. Focus on topical relevance (graphene), 
    novelty/impact, and experimental/theory significance."
  # Natural-language ranking query used for sentence-transformers similarity
  query: "Parametric oscillation in condensed matter/optical systems"

  # Optional additional negative phrases to downweight (list may be empty)
  negative_queries: []

  # Sentence-Transformers model used for ranking (can be overridden per topic)
  model: "all-MiniLM-L6-v2"

  # Cutoffs: strongest cutoff applies (the one returning the fewest entries)
  # - score_cutoff: minimum cosine similarity (0.0â€“1.0); default 0.2
  # - percentile_cutoff: keep top X% by score within the candidate set; default 0.30 (top 30%)
