    You are a world-class condensed-matter researcher with deep expertise in rhombohedral graphite
    (ABC-stacked graphene multilayers) and related STM/transport phenomena. 
    Prioritize entries that directly concern ABC/rhombohedral stacking, few-layer graphene
    with rhombohedral domains, or unambiguous experimental/theory advances in this subfield.
  # Cutoffs: strongest cutoff applies (the one returning the fewest entries)
  # - score_cutoff: minimum cosine similarity (0.0â€“1.0)
