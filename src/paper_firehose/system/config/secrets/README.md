# Secrets directory

This folder is copied to `~/.paper_firehose/secrets` on first run.

Place sensitive configuration files here, such as:

- `email_password.env`: contains the SMTP password used by the email sender
- `mailing_lists.yaml`: optional per-recipient routing rules for the email command
- `openaikulcs.env`: placeholder for the OpenAI API key used by LLM summarization utilities

Files placed here are not tracked by git when copied to your home directory. Be
sure to tighten file permissions manually if needed.
